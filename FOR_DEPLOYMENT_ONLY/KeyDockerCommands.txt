-- Build the docker container
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -t petal-width-prediction .
--- IF IT IS SUCCESSFULLY BUILT ENSURE THAT WE HAVE NO CONTAINER WITH THE SAME NAME 

docker rm CONTAINER petal-width-predictor

-- NOW RUN THE CONTAINER 
docker run -it --name petal-width-predictor  -p 0.0.0.0:8090:8090 petal-width-prediction:latest 

-- ENSURE THAT THE HOST SYSTEM HAS CURL BEFORE YOU RUN THIS PREDICTION TEST
curl -X POST   -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"petal_length\":3.0  }" http://127.0.0.1:8090/predict
